                    We note $p_{00} = 0, p_{01} = 1, p_{11} = p, p_{10} = 1-p$. Then we get the set of equations $P_0 = P_1 \cdot ( 1- p ); P_1 = P_0 + P_1 \cdot p$, together with $P_0 + P_1 = 1$. 
                    Then note $\mathbb{P}[\text{Getting Wet}] = P_0 \cdot p$.
                    This results in the probability of getting wet being $\frac{1-p}{2-p}p$.</p></div>

                <h3>Escalator. (From Jane Street)</h3>
                <p>Bob walks up the escalator. If Bob walks at a speed of 1 step / second, then he has time to take 20 steps. If 2 step / s, then he manages 30 steps.
                    How many steps will he take if he walks with 3 step / s? How many steps will it take if you set its speed to infinity?<br>

                <div id="escalator" class="solution">
                    <p>We define the constants: total amount of steps on the escalator $M$, and the speed of the escalator $v_e$. Then we have $$M = t \cdot (v_e + v_b)$$
                    with $v_b$ the speed of Bob and $t$ the amount of time to reach the top. The first time, the total time passed was $20 / 1 = 20$ seconds and the second time $30 / 2 = 15$ seconds.
                    We then get the system of equations $M = 20(v_e + 1), M=15(v_e + 2)$, from which follows $M=60$ and $v_e=2$. We then fill in for $v_b = 3$ and find $t = 12$, meaning Bob walked $36$ steps. 
                    If $v_b = \infty$, then clearly the escalator did not contribute, so Bob walked all $M=60$ steps.

                <p>Rock paper scissors, but the second player is prohibited from playing rock. If you win, you get 1; if you lose, you pay 1.
                     Find the Nash equilibrium. How much are you willing to pay to play as the first player?<br>

                    <p> This answer is incomplete: <br>
                        You clearly never play paper if the opponent never plays rock. So you have to choose the probability $p$ by which to play rock (and play scissors with prob $1-p$). 
                        The opponent chooses simultaneously paper with probability $q$ and scissors with probability $1-q$. The equilibrium comes with $p = q = \frac{1}{3}$. 
                        The expected win rate is then $\frac{4}{9}$ and your lose rate is $\frac{1}{9}$. You are willing to pay up to $\frac{1}{3}$ to play.

                <h3> Bear fishing. (From Jane Street)</h3>
                <p> A bear is fishing in a river. He wants to catch 3 fish. The probability of catching a fish once it swims by is $0.5$. Suppose you are the 5th fish. 
                    What is the probability of you surviving?<br>
                     <a onclick="toggle_visibility('bear_fish');"><u>Click here to toggle visibility of the solution.</u></a></p>
                <div id="bear_fish" class="solution">
                    <p> 
                        Note that $\mathbb{P}[\text{Survival}] = \mathbb{P}[ \text{3 out of first 4 are caught}] + \mathbb{P}[ \text{Not 3 our of first 4 are caught & you are not caught}]$. 
                        The first probability on the right hand side equals $\mathbb{P}[\text{3 out of first 4 are caught}] = (1 / 2)^3 + 3 \cdot (1 / 2)^4 = 5 / 16$. 
                        The second probability on the right hand side then equals to $\mathbb{P}[\text{Not 3 our of first 4 are caught & you are not caught}] = (1 - \frac{5}{16}) (1 / 2) = 11 / 32$
                        Which implies $\mathbb{P}[\text{Survival}] = 11 / 32 + 5 / 16 = 21 / 32 = 0.65625$.
                        A little over $0.5$ is to be expected from the problem statement.

                    <p> 
                        Yes. The expectation of both players is the same, namely $3 \cdot 3.5 = 10.5$, and they are both distributed symmetrically around their expectation.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p> b) Suppose I have a third player with another 1d20. In case of a two player tie, the two winners reroll without the other one and reroll untill a winner is found.
                    is this a fair game?<br>

                        The game is not fair anymore. Say $X_i$ is the distribution of the $i$-th player. We now compete not against $X_2$, but against $max(X_2, X_3)$. 
                        It becomes clear when considering not one extra, but 100 extra players. The probability of one in $101$ players rolling d20s with a result of 19 or 20 is $1 - (0.9)^{101} \approx 1$.
                        We cannot win whenever at least one player rolls a 19 or 20, and the probability of this happening is already more than $0.99$, so the game is clearly unfair for extra players.
                        The more extra players, the least fair it becomes.

                <h3> Coin flipping. (From Jane Street)</h3>
                <p> Two players keep flipping a honest coin. Tail = 0, head = 1. They reach sequences. Example: Tail, tail, head, tail, translates to $0010$. We consider only the last three digits of the sequenc.
                    If they first see the sequence 001, the first one wins. If first 011, the second wins. 
                    They keep flipping untill they see either sequence.
                    Calculate the probability that the first one will win.<br>

                    <p> 
                        First one has a higher probability of winning. This can be seen using tree structures. Alternatively one can see this as a markov chain, consisting of states
                        $000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111$. We start in a random state. 
                        The state $011$ can only be reached from $001$ with a probability of $0.5$, but $001$ is itself a terminating state, so in fact $011$ can only be reached upon initiation.
                        The probability of this happening is $\frac{1}{8}$. In all other cases, we will reach $001 before we reach $011$, meaning we win with probability $\frac{7}{8}$

                        There are two legit positions on the table, these are 3cm and 13cm. In both positions, they fall off with probability $0.5$. 
                        This implies a geometric distribution (with parameter $0.5$) of the amount of steps.
                        And thus an expectation of $1 / 0.5 = 2$ steps before falling off.
